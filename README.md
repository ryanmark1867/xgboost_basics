# README for xgboost basics repo

Repo for upcoming Manning book on machine learning for tabular data.

This repo contains an XGBoost-based solution to prediction of [Airbnb NYC listing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). The solution is based on the [Keras-based solution](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/deep_learning_basics) with the following changes in the [model training](https://github.com/ryanmark1867/xgboost_basics/blob/master/notebooks/model_training.ipynb) notebook:
- transform input data to the model to be a numpy array of lists
- replace Keras model defintion & training in model training notebook with XGBoost model definition & training
